# rocketmancer
A command-line multi-stage rocket optimiser built in C++, based on an [earlier version](https://github.com/BruhLemma-Yadecha/multistage) written in C. Uses simulated annealing to approximate the ideal rocket configuration to within under 0.001 m/s with near-instant response time.

# Planned Features
- Integration of CSV-based input and output similar to the earlier version.
- Internal error-checking.
- More complete CLI.
